## Data Wrangling

Process coverts raw data in to more usable form for analysis. Descriptive statistics should be run again following data clean up.

First step is to access the raw data and create a new file.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
value_of_sum = 1 + 1
value_of_sum
```

The value of sum is `r value_of_sum`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
